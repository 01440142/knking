01. (a) Another advantage is modularity (header files only expose intended
    functions for usage).  
    (b) One disadvantage is increased build complexity (e.g protecting header
    files against multiple inclusions). 

02. Function definitions (b) in header files would prevent linking if they are
    included in multiple different source files.

03. Not necessarily. The compiler would search the system header files
    directory after it didn't found it locally. The potential for
    unintentional overwriting exists.

04. (a) Output if DEBUG is defined:
        Value of " i ": 1
        Value of " j ": 2
        Value of " k ": 3
        Value of " i + j ": 3
        Value of " 2 * i + j - k ": 1
    (b) Output if DEBUG is not defined:
    (c) DEBUG isn't defined which causes PRINT_DEBUG to be an parameterized
        macro with an empty replacement-list. This results in empty statements
        where before were printf statements.
    (d) Yes. Otherwise when the #include directive inserts the contents of
        debug.h into debug.c the DEBUG macro stays undefined.

05. demo: main.o f1.o f2.o
    	gcc -o demo main.o f1.o f2.o

    main.o: main.c f1.h
    	gcc -c main.c

    f1.o: f1.c f1.h f2.h 
    	gcc -c f1.c

    f2.o: f2.c f1.h f2.h 
    	gcc -c f2.c

06. (a) main.c, f1.c and f2.c.
    (b) f1.c.
    (c) main.c, f1.c and f2.c.
    (d) f1.c and f2.c.
